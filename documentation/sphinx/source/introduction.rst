Introduction

SCT tools process MRI data (NIFTI files) and can do tasks such as:

- Automatic identification (segmentation) of the spinal cord
- Automatic vertebral labeling
- Segmentation of spinal cord white matter and gray matter
- Registration to template, and deformation (eg. straightening)
- Detection of anatomical highlights (eg. PMJ, spinal cord centerline)
- Correction (motion compensation, eddy currents correction)
- Measurements (for quantitative MRI)
- Help out with manual labeling and segmentation with a GUI

It also has low-level tools:

- Warping field creation and application
